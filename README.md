# Benford for Python
This module is an attempt to facilitate the performance of Benford's Law-related tests by people using Python, whether interactively or in an automated, scripting way.

It is open source, licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

It is based on pandas and uses some numpy, and matplotlib for plotting.

I've been testing in Python 2 and 3, so feel free to file a bug report if you run into some trouble.

For a quick start, please go to the Demo notebook.

### Installation

cd into the site-packages subfolder of your python distribution and clone from there:

```
 git clone https://github.com/milcent/benford.git
```
