It is open source, licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

It is based on pandas and uses some numpy, and matplotlib for plotting.

I've been testing in Python 2 and 3, so feel free to file a bug report if you run into some trouble.

For a quick start, please go to the Demo notebook.
